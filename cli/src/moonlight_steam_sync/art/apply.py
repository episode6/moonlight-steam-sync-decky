"""Write the grid files for one shortcut, and the loop over all of them.

This is where the artwork phase meets the Steam shortcut layer, and it meets
it through **one narrow seam** so the two can be built independently:

.. code-block:: text

    ArtTarget(name, appid, grid_dir)                what the art phase needs
    TargetProvider.targets()                        where those come from
    TargetProvider.set_icon(appid, icon_path)       the one thing art writes back
    TargetProvider.commit()                         flush those icon patches

``appid`` is the shortcut's own 32-bit id (``crc32(Exe + AppName) |
0x80000000``, spec 2.1), which is knowable *before* the shortcut exists, and
``grid_dir`` is ``userdata/<steamid3>/config/grid``. Nothing in this package
itself resolves artwork through that seam: :class:`SteamShortcutProvider`
(backed by the PR-2 ``steam``/``shortcuts`` modules) supplies it.

Implementations of ``set_icon`` must **not** write ``shortcuts.vdf`` on the
spot: spec 3.6 wants exactly one atomic vdf write per run, after the whole
art phase, which is what ``commit()`` is for -- and :func:`run_art` does not
call it either. The *caller* commits once the summary is out, because a
commit can be refused (Steam is running and may not be restarted, exit 2)
and that refusal must not swallow the progress report.

Per-title flow (spec 3.5 and 3.9):

1. ``[overrides] art = false`` -> the title is skipped entirely.
2. Resolve the title (the match cache is flushed by the resolver).
3. For each slot: an existing file wins unless ``--force``; otherwise try the
   sources in order; a slot that finds nothing is cached as missing.
4. If an ``_icon`` file exists afterwards, hand its absolute path to the
   provider.
5. Flush the cache and print the one-line progress report for the title.
