"""Step B of spec 3.5: per slot, the first source that yields an image wins.

Sources per slot, in order (1. official, 2. community):

* portrait ``<id>p`` -- CDN ``library_600x900_2x.jpg`` then
  ``library_600x900.jpg``; SGDB ``grids`` 600x900 ``alternate``.
* landscape ``<id>`` -- CDN ``header.jpg``; SGDB ``grids`` 920x430 then
  460x215.
* hero ``<id>_hero`` -- CDN ``library_hero.jpg``; SGDB ``heroes`` 1920x620
  then 3840x1240.
* logo ``<id>_logo`` -- CDN ``logo.png``; SGDB ``logos`` ``official`` then
  ``white``.
* icon ``<id>_icon`` -- the ``GetApps`` hash then the community CDN; SGDB
  ``icons`` ``official`` then ``custom``.

Sources are evaluated lazily, so a slot that is filled by the CDN never costs
a SteamGridDB call.

Two rules from spec 3.9 live here:

* **Downloads are atomic.** Bytes go to ``<appid><suffix>.part``; only after
  the magic bytes say PNG or JPEG is the file renamed to its real extension.
  An exception mid-download leaves the ``.part`` and nothing else, so a
  killed run never leaves a truncated image that would count as done.
* **A slot whose file already exists is skipped** (spec 6.9). That is both
  the resume mechanism and the "never clobber hand-picked art" rule, since
  the Steam UI writes these very filenames. When ``--force`` does refill a
  slot, whatever was there is removed even if the new image has a different
  extension -- a slot holds one file, never a ``.png`` and a ``.jpg`` racing
  each other.

WebP is never requested (:mod:`moonlight_steam_sync.art.sgdb` enforces the
query filters) and never written (the sniffer only accepts PNG and JPEG).
