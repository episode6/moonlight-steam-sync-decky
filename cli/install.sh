# Install (or update) the moonlight-steam-sync CLI alone -- without the
# Moonlight Sync Decky plugin -- from the latest GitHub release.
#
# The CLI lives in cli/ of the plugin's repo and every plugin release
# attaches it beside the plugin zip (the two share a version). Downloads the
# release zipapp (moonlight-steam-sync.pyz, spec 3.1) plus its
# published sha256 checksum, verifies it, and installs it as
# ~/.local/bin/moonlight-steam-sync. That is the entire install on SteamOS:
# no root, no pip, no compiler -- just curl and a Python 3.11+ already on
# PATH (stock SteamOS 3.x ships one -- currently 3.13.5; see
# README.md and AGENTS.md).
#
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/episode6/moonlight-steam-sync-decky/main/cli/install.sh | sh
#
# (The Decky plugin needs none of this: it bundles the CLI and installs it
# to the same place itself. See the repo's own install.sh for the plugin.)
#
# A fresh SteamOS install does not have ~/.local/bin on PATH, so when the
# install directory is missing from PATH this script also appends an
# `export PATH=...` line to the shell's rc file (~/.bashrc, or ~/.zshrc for
# zsh) -- once; re-runs find the line already there. Set NO_MODIFY_PATH=1
# to skip that and only print the line instead.
#
# Safe to re-run: it always fetches the latest tag and overwrites the
# previous install (there is no version check, so it re-downloads and
# reinstalls every time even when already current -- that is what makes
# rerunning after a SteamOS update, or just to pick up a new release, safe).
# Set MOONLIGHT_STEAM_SYNC_VERSION to a specific tag (vX.Y.Z) to pin
# instead of tracking latest, and INSTALL_DIR to install somewhere other
# than ~/.local/bin. Releases before the CLI moved into this repo (CLI v0.4.0
# and older) live in the archived episode6/moonlight-steam-sync repo.
#
# MOONLIGHT_STEAM_SYNC_BASE_URL overrides the "https://github.com/<repo>/releases"
# prefix (the latest/download or download/<tag> suffix is still appended),
# exactly like the plugin installer's MOONLIGHT_SYNC_BASE_URL; it exists so
# tests/test_cli_install_sh.py can point this script at a file:// fixture
# tree instead of GitHub. There is normally no reason to set it by hand.
