# moonlight-steam-sync

Sync the game list published by a [Moonlight](https://moonlight-stream.org/) host
into Steam as non-Steam shortcuts, and dress each one with artwork from Steam's
own CDN and [SteamGridDB](https://www.steamgriddb.com/) -- the same file layout
Steam's own library UI and tools like SGDBoop use, so it disappears into a
normal Steam library instead of looking like a hand-added shortcut.

This is aimed at SteamOS (Steam Deck / Deck-likes) as a client of a Moonlight
host such as [Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine), but nothing
about it is SteamOS-specific beyond assuming a Linux Steam install and a
`moonlight` client (native binary or the Flathub flatpak) on `PATH`.

> **Most people want the [Moonlight Sync Decky plugin](../README.md)**,
> which lives in this same repo, bundles this CLI and installs it for you.
> This page is the CLI on its own: for Desktop Mode, SSH, scripts, or a
> Linux machine without Decky.

**Status:** feature complete as a standalone tool -- every subcommand below
works (`sync`, `list`, `ignore`, `remove`, `art`, `status`, `search`,
`match`, `host`, `launch`, `client`, `doctor`). It was released on its own
through `v0.4.0` from
[episode6/moonlight-steam-sync](https://github.com/episode6/moonlight-steam-sync)
(now archived); since then it lives in `cli/` of the plugin's repo and is
released with the plugin, under the plugin's version, as the `.pyz`
zipapp that `install.sh` below downloads. `v0.3.0` added the CLI half of
the [Decky plugin](#decky-plugin) behind additive flags (`--json`,
`--owned-apps`, `--commit`, ...) that leave every command byte-identical
when they are not passed; see `~/specs/moonlight-steam-sync/decky-plugin.md`
and the [`CHANGELOG`](CHANGELOG.md)'s `[0.3.0]` entry. **Not yet verified
against a real Steam Deck beyond the initial `v0.1.0` install** -- the
device checklist in the design spec (section 8) is still open, and the
plugin's PR-0 device probes have only been run on a generic SteamOS
machine, not a Deck. See [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for the work plan and
the root [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) for the release procedure.

## Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/episode6/moonlight-steam-sync-decky/main/cli/install.sh | sh
```

This downloads the latest release's `moonlight-steam-sync.pyz` -- a single
executable zipapp with no dependencies to install -- verifies its published
sha256 checksum, and installs it as `~/.local/bin/moonlight-steam-sync`
(a fresh SteamOS install does not have that directory on `PATH`, so the
installer also appends an `export PATH=...` line to `~/.bashrc` -- or
`~/.zshrc` under zsh -- when it is missing; set `NO_MODIFY_PATH=1` to have
it only print the line instead). Re-run the
same command any time to upgrade to the latest release -- it always
re-downloads and reinstalls, so it is safe to run repeatedly (there is no
version check, so it is not a no-op when already current). Set
`MOONLIGHT_STEAM_SYNC_VERSION=vX.Y.Z` to pin a specific release instead of
tracking latest, or `INSTALL_DIR=/some/other/dir` to install somewhere
other than `~/.local/bin`. The releases are the plugin repo's: each one
carries this zipapp beside the plugin's zip, at the same version. CLI
releases up to `v0.4.0` are on the archived repo, whose own `install.sh`
still installs them.

If you use the Decky plugin you do not need this at all: the plugin
installs the CLI it bundles to the same `~/.local/bin/moonlight-steam-sync`
(and never downgrades a newer one you installed here).

To run from a git checkout instead:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/episode6/moonlight-steam-sync-decky.git
cd moonlight-steam-sync-decky/cli
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m moonlight_steam_sync --version
```

(The package lives under `src/`, per `[tool.setuptools.packages.find]` in
`pyproject.toml`, so `PYTHONPATH=src` is what makes a plain git checkout
runnable without installing anything. `pip install -e ".[dev]"` -- see
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) -- also works and additionally puts the
`moonlight-steam-sync` console script and the dev tools on `PATH`.)

Either way, requires Python 3.11+ (for `tomllib`) and nothing else: the tool
has zero runtime dependencies. Stock SteamOS 3.x ships a Python new enough
for this already (3.13.5 at the time of writing, which is the version CI
tests against alongside the 3.11 floor).

## Configure

`~/.config/moonlight-steam-sync/config.toml`, read once per run, never written
by the tool:

```toml
host = "MY-GAMING-PC"            # Moonlight host name, or --host
name_suffix = " (streaming)"     # appended to the Steam shortcut name, default ""
exe = "/home/deck/server-scripts/chimera/stream.sh"   # default: the tool's own path
launch_options = '"{name}"'      # template; default 'launch "{name}"' when exe is the tool
start_dir = ""                   # default: dirname(exe)
ignore = []                      # Moonlight app names never to add; nothing is ignored by default
restart_steam = true             # shut Steam down before writing and relaunch after
request_interval_ms = 250        # polite pacing between SteamGridDB/Steam calls

[steamgriddb]
api_key = ""                     # or env SGDB_API_KEY, or file ~/.config/moonlight-steam-sync/sgdb-api-key
community_fallback = true        # use community assets when no official one exists

[overrides]                      # per-title pins when auto-match is wrong
"Some Weird Launcher Name" = { steam = 1245620 }
"Fan Game" = { sgdb = 5247018 }
"Utility App" = { art = false }  # never look for art for this one
```

Every key has a CLI flag override; flags win over the file, the file wins
over built-in defaults. The SteamGridDB API key is optional -- without it the
tool still resolves "official Steam art" via Steam's own store search and
CDN, it just skips community-submitted art. When set, the key is looked up in
this order: the config file (or its flag), then the `SGDB_API_KEY`
environment variable, then the contents of
`~/.config/moonlight-steam-sync/sgdb-api-key`.

Nothing is ignored by default. Every app the host publishes becomes a
shortcut, including utility entries like `Desktop` or `Steam Big Picture`:
they get a tile just like anything else, and they simply end up without
artwork unless SteamGridDB happens to have a good match for the name. A title
or a single slot with no match is reported in the run summary and is not an
error -- set that art by hand in the Steam UI and the tool will never
overwrite it. `ignore` is there for apps you would rather not see in Steam at
all.

Run `moonlight-steam-sync doctor` to see what the tool detects on your
machine (Steam install, Python version, `moonlight` binary, whether an API
key is configured, whether Steam is currently running). It always also
prints a `session:` line (interactive vs. Game Mode/Decky), the resolved
`active host:` and where it came from, and a `cached hosts:` line listing
what `sync`/`list`/`ignore --all` have cached per host; pass
`--owned-apps`, `--ignore-file` or `--client-shortcut` and it adds a line
reporting that file's or shortcut's state too.

The `moonlight` CLI is found in this order: the `MOONLIGHT_BIN` environment
variable (a full command line, e.g. `flatpak run --command=moonlight
com.moonlight_stream.Moonlight`), then a native `moonlight` on `PATH`, then
the [Flathub flatpak](https://flathub.org/apps/com.moonlight_stream.Moonlight)
if it is installed.

The tool is meant to work from a service, a cron job or a plugin, not only a
login shell. One environment needs active repair: a PyInstaller-frozen parent
(Decky Loader is one) exports an `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` pointing at its own bundled
libraries, under which `flatpak` and Python's `ssl` both fail to load. The
tool detects that (`LD_LIBRARY_PATH_ORIG`, or a `_MEI*` directory on
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`), restores the original value and re-executes itself once.
When `flatpak list` fails for any other reason, `doctor`'s `moonlight:` line
and the "not found" error say why instead of a bare `not found`.

**Steam must restart** to notice new shortcuts and new artwork files. `sync`
does this once per run (`steam -shutdown`, wait for it to exit, write,
`steam -silent`) rather than per game, and only when something actually
changed. If Steam is not running, the file is simply written and Steam is
left alone. With `restart_steam = false` (or `--no-restart-steam`) the tool
never stops or starts Steam: if Steam is running when there is something to
write, it exits 2 without writing -- the artwork already on disk stays and is
picked up on the next restart, so quitting Steam and rerunning finishes the
job with no network calls.

Those are two of the three **commit modes**, and `--commit MODE` (on `sync`,
`art`, `remove` and `match`) picks one explicitly: `restart` (the above,
even when the config says `restart_steam = false`), `refuse` (the same
thing as `--no-restart-steam`), or `await-exit`, which is for the Decky
plugin running from Game Mode, where the tool must never start Steam
itself (gamescope restarts the client on its own): when there is something
to write and Steam is running, the tool says so (`awaiting-steam-exit`
under `--json`), polls every 100 ms for up to 60 s for Steam to *exit* --
the plugin asks it to -- writes the moment it is gone, and returns without
starting it. If Steam is still up after 60 s it exits 2 with the file
untouched (`steam did not exit; shortcuts.vdf not written`); nothing is
lost, the next run only writes. `Ctrl-C` during that wait exits 130 at
once, also with the file untouched, since nothing has been done to Steam
yet. An art-only run (new grid files, nothing to write) does not wait at
all and leaves the restart to the caller.

## What it touches on disk

| path | why |
|---|---|
| `<steam>/userdata/<steamid3>/config/shortcuts.vdf` | the non-Steam shortcut store; rewritten once per run |
| `<steam>/userdata/<steamid3>/config/shortcuts.vdf.bak-<timestamp>` | a backup per write, newest five kept |
| `<steam>/userdata/<steamid3>/config/grid/` | artwork: `<appid>p`, `<appid>`, `<appid>_hero`, `<appid>_logo`, `<appid>_icon` |
| `~/.cache/moonlight-steam-sync/matches.json` | the title -> Steam/SteamGridDB match cache, including titles pinned with `match` (`XDG_CACHE_HOME` honoured) |

`<steam>` is found automatically (`~/.local/share/Steam`, then `~/.steam/steam`
and `~/.steam/root`, which are symlinks to it on SteamOS); set `STEAM_ROOT` to
override that. With more than one Steam account on the machine, the one
`config/loginusers.vdf` marks `MostRecent` is used -- `doctor` prints which.

Steam holds `shortcuts.vdf` in memory and rewrites it on exit, so edits made
while it is running are lost: that is why the tool shuts Steam down before
writing. The file is written atomically (temp file plus rename) and never
rewritten at all when nothing changed, and artwork you picked by hand in the
Steam UI is never overwritten (same filenames, and an existing image means
"done"). Only images count for that: the `<appid>.json` the Steam UI drops
next to a logo records where the logo sits, so it never stands in for the
landscape art that shares its name.

## Usage

```
moonlight-steam-sync [--json] sync      [--host H] [--dry-run] [--no-art] [--limit N] [--retry-missing]
                                        [--commit MODE | --no-restart-steam] [--ignore-file PATH] [--owned-apps PATH]
                                        [--client-shortcut] [--park-unpublished] [--hide-host-apps]
moonlight-steam-sync [--json] art       [--force] [--retry-missing] [--only "Name"] [--explain] [--commit MODE]
moonlight-steam-sync [--json] list      [--host H] [--cached] [--ignore-file PATH] [--owned-apps PATH]
                                        [--hide-host-apps]
moonlight-steam-sync [--json] status    [--host H] [--owned-apps PATH] [--hide-host-apps]
moonlight-steam-sync [--json] search    "term" [--owned-apps PATH]
moonlight-steam-sync [--json] match     "Name" (--steam APPID | --sgdb ID | --none | --unpin) [--defer-art] [--force-name]
                                        [--commit MODE]
moonlight-steam-sync [--json] host      show [--host H] | set NAME | clear
moonlight-steam-sync [--json] ignore    --all | "Name"... [--ignore-file PATH]
moonlight-steam-sync [--json] remove    ((--all | "Name"...) [--client] | --client) [--commit MODE]
moonlight-steam-sync [--json] launch    [--host H] "Name" [-- extra moonlight flags]
moonlight-steam-sync [--json] client    [-- extra moonlight flags]
moonlight-steam-sync [--json] doctor    [--host H] [--owned-apps PATH] [--ignore-file PATH] [--client-shortcut]
```

`--json`, before the subcommand, switches every command to the
machine-readable event stream described below; it is meant for the Decky
plugin driving the CLI as a subprocess, not for interactive use. `MODE` is
one of `restart`, `await-exit` and `refuse` (see "Steam must restart"
above).

### A first import

```sh
moonlight-steam-sync doctor                 # finds Steam, the user, moonlight, the key
moonlight-steam-sync list --host MY-GAMING-PC   # every app the host publishes: added / ignored / new
moonlight-steam-sync sync --dry-run         # the plan, with the art URL per slot; writes nothing under Steam
moonlight-steam-sync sync --limit 5         # five titles, to look at the tiles before doing 300
moonlight-steam-sync sync                   # the rest
```

`sync` works out what to add as *(what the host publishes) minus (the
`ignore` list) minus (what is already in Steam)*. "Already in Steam" means a
shortcut whose `Exe` is the configured `exe` -- not a name match -- so
shortcuts created earlier by other tools that already point at your stream
script are adopted as-is (same appid, so they keep launching), get their
artwork, and are never duplicated. There is no state file: delete a
shortcut in the Steam UI and the next `sync` brings it back unless you
ignore it.

The order within a run is deliberate: first the artwork for every planned
and adopted shortcut is fetched with Steam still running (grid files are
inert until a restart), then Steam is shut down, `shortcuts.vdf` is written
once, and Steam is relaunched. New tiles therefore appear fully dressed on
that single restart, and interrupting the long art phase costs nothing:
`shortcuts.vdf` is not touched until the art phase has finished.

Each run ends with a summary: shortcuts added and adopted, art slots filled
and still missing, titles with no match at all (an accepted outcome, see
below), and how many are still pending behind `--limit`.

Exit codes: `0` done (including "some titles or slots had no art"); `1`
usage or config error, no Steam install, or an unreadable `shortcuts.vdf`
(nothing is touched); `2` Steam is running and may not be restarted, or
did not exit within `--commit await-exit`'s 60 s; `3`
Moonlight unreachable; `4` stopped early by repeated 429s or a dead network
(everything done so far is kept); `130` interrupted with Ctrl-C (same).
After `4` or `130`, rerun the same command to continue.

### Ignoring, removing, listing

- `ignore --all` prints an `ignore = [...]` TOML block of your current
  ignore list plus every host app that has no shortcut yet -- "draw a line
  under everything on the PC today". `ignore "Name"...` prints the block
  with those names added. Either way you paste it into `config.toml`
  yourself; the tool never edits the config.
- `--ignore-file PATH` (on `sync`, `list`, `ignore` and `doctor`) adds a
  second ignore list kept outside `config.toml`: a JSON list of Moonlight
  names, `["Desktop", "Steam Big Picture"]`, ignored together with
  `ignore` (the union). It is how the Decky plugin keeps its own ignores
  without touching the config; `ignore --all` does not offer those names
  again and still prints only `config.toml`'s list plus the new ones. A
  missing or malformed file is exit `1` before anything is touched.
- `remove "Name"...` (or `--all`) deletes the named owned shortcuts and their
  five grid files, with the same one-restart write as `sync` (and the same
  `--commit` modes). Shortcuts that do not point at the configured `exe` are
  never touched. An unknown name is an error before anything happens.
- `list --host H` prints every app the host publishes with `added`,
  `ignored` or `new` in front of it, and the same totals line `sync` starts
  with. `list --cached` never asks the host at all: it serves the per-host
  list cache that `sync`, `list` and `ignore --all` write on every
  successful run (`<cache dir>/hosts/<slug>.json`), so a Decky plugin can
  show a host's titles while it is unreachable; it exits `3` with no result
  when nothing has ever been cached for that host.
- `search "term"` looks a title up the same way `sync`'s art phase does --
  SteamGridDB (when a key is configured) then Steam's own store -- and
  prints the candidates without writing anything, for fixing a wrong match
  by hand or from the plugin's Titles page; `match` (below) applies the
  pick.

### Multiple hosts

Every command that needs a host resolves it the same way, in this order:
the `--host` flag (on the commands that have one, listed below), then an
*active host* set with `host set NAME`, then `host` in `config.toml`. The
active host is a small state file
(`$XDG_STATE_HOME/moonlight-steam-sync/active-host`, not `config.toml`), so
switching hosts never edits the config:

```sh
moonlight-steam-sync host show      # the resolved host and where it came from
moonlight-steam-sync host set OFFICE-PC
moonlight-steam-sync host clear     # back to config.toml's `host`
```

`--host` on any command that accepts it (`sync`, `list`, `status`,
`ignore`, `launch`, `doctor`, `host show`) is per-invocation and never
touches the state file -- only `host set` does. `client` and `match` take
no `--host` flag of their own, so for them the order starts at the active
host.

Shortcuts do not record a host: an entry carries only the Moonlight name,
and `launch` picks the host at stream time, so a title both hosts publish
under the same name is one entry, one set of art and one pin whichever
host is active. `sync --park-unpublished` makes the library reflect the
active host: every owned shortcut the host does not publish is *parked*
(hidden in place -- same appid, art, pin and controller layout kept) and
every published one is shown again, so switching hosts and back costs one
`moonlight list`, no downloads and one Steam restart, never a re-import.
`status` reports `parked` per entry and `list --owned-apps` labels a
parked title `parked`. Without the flag, entries the host no longer
publishes stay visible as before. `remove --all` still removes parked
entries (ownership is by `exe`, hidden or not). When two hosts publish the
same game under different names, `list` says so (`same-game-as`) rather
than making two tiles; the fix is to align the name on the host side or
pin one of them.

### Games you own on Steam

With `--owned-apps PATH` (a JSON file of the Steam games the account
owns, `{"version": 1, "steamid3": 12345678, "apps": {"1245620": "ELDEN
RING", ...}}`, written by the Decky plugin before every run), `sync` stops
making a visible tile for a title the account already owns and makes a
**hidden** shortcut for it instead. The plugin puts a *Stream* button on
the real game's own library page that launches that hidden entry, so the
library shows one tile per game and the streamed copy still runs as its
own Steam app with its own controller layout, resolution override and
Steam Input settings.

- A title counts as owned when it resolves -- by an exact match, an
  `[overrides]` entry or a `match` pin, never a fuzzy one -- to a Steam
  appid in the file. A fuzzy hit is right often enough for artwork, but a
  wrong Stream button on the real game's page is worse than an extra
  tile, so fuzzy matches keep their visible shortcut; pin them with
  `match` to promote them.
- The hidden entry is named exactly as the owned game (no `name_suffix`),
  because Steam Input keys a shortcut's layout by its lowercased name and
  offers a same-named shortcut the retail game's community layouts. Its
  launch options still carry the Moonlight name, so it is owned, adopted,
  listed and removed like any other entry, and it gets all five art
  slots like any other.
- Ownership can change: drop an appid from the file (or add one, or
  change its display name) and the next `sync` *replaces* the entry --
  a rename is never an in-place edit, since the appid is derived from
  the name -- renaming its five grid files to the new appid so the flip
  downloads nothing. `--limit` counts replacements and additions
  together and never splits a replacement; `--dry-run` prints each one
  as `replace  <name>: <old> [visible] -> <new> [hidden] (kind-changed)`.
- Two Moonlight titles that resolve to the same owned game (a Steam and a
  GOG copy, say) are almost always a wrong match, so the first in host
  order gets the hidden entry and the other gets **no tile at all**: it
  is reported as a `duplicate` naming the winner, an entry it already had
  is removed with its art, and pinning it to `--none` (or to a different
  match) on the next run gives it its own tile again.
- To reach titles ahead of the plan, `sync --owned-apps` resolves every
  published title first (cache-first, so a finished library still makes
  zero calls) -- also under `--no-art`, which then fetches nothing. The
  file's `steamid3` must be the Steam user `sync` would write to; a stale
  file from another account is exit `1` with nothing touched.
- `sync --client-shortcut` keeps one hidden shortcut named `Moonlight`
  that runs `moonlight-steam-sync client`, which just opens the Moonlight
  client (no host, no game) -- the plugin's *Open Moonlight* button needs
  a Steam-launched app in Game Mode. Its `Exe` is always this tool, even
  when `exe` is your own script, and it is identified by that plus its
  launch options, never by name; it gets no artwork. `remove --client`
  deletes it; `remove --all` deletes it only when `exe` is the tool
  itself (ownership is still by `exe`). `doctor --client-shortcut` says
  whether it exists.

Without `--owned-apps` every title is a visible shortcut and nothing
above applies; a `--park-unpublished` run alone still parks.

### Desktop and Steam Big Picture

Every Sunshine / Apollo host publishes two apps out of the box, `Desktop`
and `Steam Big Picture`. By default they are titles like any other: a
visible shortcut each (or nothing, if you `ignore` them). `sync
--hide-host-apps` writes them as **hidden** shortcuts instead, for a
launcher that starts them some other way -- the Decky plugin puts a button
for each on its Quick Access panel, and those buttons replace the two
library tiles:

- The names are matched trimmed and case-insensitively, and the rule wins
  over everything but `ignore`: a `Desktop` that happens to match a game
  you own never becomes a Stream button.
- The hidden entry keeps its ordinary name (`Desktop (streaming)`), and
  therefore its appid, so hiding an existing tile is a flip of one field
  in place (`2 to hide` in the plan, never a `replace`): its artwork and,
  above all, the controller layout you chose for it are untouched, and it
  still gets artwork like any other entry (Recent Games and the overlay
  show the running shortcut).
- Pass the flag to `list` and `status` too when you pass it to `sync`:
  `list` then reports the kind as `host-app`, and `status` stops calling
  the hidden entry parked (it is hidden by its kind, like a Stream
  button's entry, and only parked when the active host does not publish
  it).
- To get the tiles back, stop passing the flag and run `sync
  --park-unpublished` once: without the flag the two are ordinary
  shortcuts again, and a published shortcut that is hidden gets shown. A
  plain `sync` never touches `IsHidden`, so it leaves them as they are.

The flag is off by default on purpose: without the plugin's buttons the
tiles are the only way to launch these two.

### Artwork

Each shortcut gets the five files Steam's own library UI reads out of
`userdata/<id>/config/grid/`: a portrait capsule, a landscape header, a hero
banner, a logo and an icon. Per slot, the first source that has an image
wins:

1. **Steam's own CDN**, when the title resolves to a Steam appid -- the
   official store art, byte-for-byte what Steam shows for the real game.
2. **SteamGridDB**, for anything the CDN has no image for (and for non-Steam
   titles), preferring the styles that look like official box art and taking
   the highest-scored result.

Rules worth knowing:

- **Artwork you set by hand is never overwritten.** A slot that already has a
  file in `grid/` is skipped, because the Steam UI writes those very
  filenames. `art --force` is the way to re-fetch anyway; it *replaces* what
  is in the slot, including a file whose extension differs from the new one,
  so a slot never ends up holding both a `.png` and a `.jpg`.
- **A title or a slot with no art is not an error.** It is listed in the
  summary; fill it in from the Steam UI and the rule above keeps it.
- Unmatched titles and empty slots are remembered for 7 days so a re-run does
  not search for them again; `--retry-missing` asks anyway.
- `art --explain` prints the whole match chain for each title: what was
  searched, what matched, and which URL each slot came from.
- Pin a title that matches badly with `match` (below) or `[overrides]` in
  the config, or turn art off for it entirely with `{ art = false }`.
- No WebP and no animated art: Steam cannot read either out of `grid/`.

#### Fixing a wrong match

A fuzzy search is right often enough for artwork but not always ("Hades
II" once matched "Hades"). `search` shows the candidates and `match` pins
the right one:

```sh
moonlight-steam-sync search "Hades II"                  # candidates, SteamGridDB then Steam
moonlight-steam-sync match "Hades II" --steam 1145350   # pin a Steam appid
moonlight-steam-sync match "Fan Game" --sgdb 5247018    # or a SteamGridDB game id
moonlight-steam-sync match "Launcher Tool" --none       # or "no match": no lookups, no art
moonlight-steam-sync match "Hades II" --unpin           # forget it; the next run searches again
```

A pin lives in the match cache (`matches.json`, `"how": "pinned"`) and is
the one entry there that `art --force` and `--retry-missing` never
overwrite. `match` prints the equivalent `[overrides]` line (`"Hades II" =
{ steam = 1145350 }`, or `"Launcher Tool" = {}` for `--none`); paste it into
`config.toml` to make the pin permanent -- an `[overrides]` entry always
wins over a pin, and the tool never writes the config itself.

When the title already has a shortcut, its artwork belongs to the old
match, so `match` deletes its five grid files and clears its icon, with the
same one-restart write as `remove` (exit `2`, with nothing changed at all,
when Steam is running and `restart_steam = false`; `--commit` picks the
mode as everywhere else); the next `sync` fetches
the new match's art. `--defer-art` leaves the files and Steam alone and
only marks the title's art as stale in the cache: the next `sync` (plain
or `--owned-apps`; the plan reads the cache either way) treats that as a
*rematched* replacement -- the old grid files are deleted and the new
match's art fetched in the normal single-restart flow -- and `art --force`
clears the mark too, having refilled every slot. The mark outlives the entry it was
set on, so `--unpin --defer-art` (which leaves an `"how": "unpinned"`
placeholder in the cache) and the re-resolution that follows still end
with the art marked stale. The name must be one the host publishes (as
of its last `list` or `sync`) or one that already has a shortcut;
`--force-name` pins a title the host will publish later.

A large Moonlight library (500+ titles) means a first `sync` can be a couple
thousand HTTP calls; at the default pacing that is on the order of 10-20
minutes, and it is safe to interrupt (`Ctrl-C`) and resume with the same
command -- nothing already written is redone: a downloaded image, a resolved
title and a written shortcut each record themselves on disk as they happen.
The only moment Ctrl-C is held off is the few seconds between Steam being
shut down and relaunched, so you can never end up with Steam down and the
file unwritten (under `--commit await-exit`, which never takes Steam down,
only the write itself is protected: a Ctrl-C while waiting for Steam to
exit is exit 130 with the file untouched). Use `--limit N` to bring in a
handful of titles at a time instead of the whole library at once.

The tool paces itself between calls (`request_interval_ms`), backs off on
429s and 5xxs, and stops outright after five 429s in a row rather than burn
your API key -- or after five network failures in a row, which is the Wi-Fi
having gone rather than the art being missing. Either way everything already
written is kept, and re-running the same command picks up where it left off.

## Machine-readable output

`--json` (before the subcommand) switches stdout to one JSON object per
line and nothing else; every human progress line that would otherwise go to
stdout moves to stderr instead, so a caller can read stdout with a plain
line-oriented JSON parser while still showing the human text if it wants to.
This is what the in-progress Decky plugin drives the CLI with.

Every object has an `"event"` key. The stream always starts with `start`
(`schema`, `version`, `command`) and ends with `error` on a non-zero exit
(`exit`, `message` -- the same text that went to stderr). A `note` event
carries a message that would otherwise only be a `note:` line on stderr
(no SteamGridDB key configured, "restart Steam to see the new artwork",
and so on).

| command | events, in order |
|---|---|
| `sync` | `start`, `plan`, `replace`\*, `title`\*, (`awaiting-steam-exit`), `commit`\*, `summary`, (`error`) |
| `art` | `start`, `title`\*, (`awaiting-steam-exit`), `commit`, `summary`, (`error`) |
| `list` | `start`, `app`\*, `end`, (`error`) |
| `status` | `start`, `entry`\*, `end`, (`error`) |
| `search` | `start`, `candidate`\*, `end`, (`error`) |
| `match` | `start`, (`awaiting-steam-exit`), (`commit`), `pinned`, (`note`), (`error`) |
| `host` | `start`, `host`, (`error`) |
| `ignore` | `start`, `end`, (`error`) |
| `remove` | `start`, (`awaiting-steam-exit`), `commit`, `summary`, (`error`) |
| `launch`, `client` | `start`, `exec`, (`error`) |
| `doctor` | `start`, `end`, (`error`) |

`title`/`app`/`entry` all carry a `match` object shaped
`{steam_appid, sgdb_id, matched_name, how}` (or `null`), and a `slots`
mapping whose values are `steam`, `sgdb`, `kept`, `missing`, `skipped` or
`cached-miss` -- the JSON names for what the human progress line prints as
`official`/`community`/etc. `title.kind` and `app.kind` are the title's
kind (`stream`, `shortcut`, `ignored`, `parked`, `duplicate`, and
`host-app` under `--hide-host-apps` only; an `app`
that lost to another title carries `duplicate_of`), `plan` counts the
kinds and the replacements, park flips and removals it will make, one
`replace` event precedes the art phase per replacement, and `sync`'s
`summary` reports `replaced`, `removed`, `duplicates` and
`added_by_kind` (`{"stream": n, "shortcut": n}`, new entries only).
`--hide-host-apps` adds three keys and only when it is passed, so every
other run's events are unchanged key for key: `plan.host_app`,
`added_by_kind["host-app"]` and, on `status`, `entry.host_app`.
`awaiting-steam-exit` (`{"timeout_s": 60}`) appears only under `--commit
await-exit`, the moment the tool starts waiting for Steam to exit; the
`commit` that follows has `restarted: false`, and a wait that times out
ends in `error` (exit 2) with no `commit` at all. See
`~/specs/moonlight-steam-sync/decky-plugin.md` section 3.4.6 for the full
schema (every event's exact keys) if you are building another consumer of
this stream; it is versioned (`schema: 1`) and additive-only.

## Decky plugin

A companion [Decky Loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader)
plugin, display name **Moonlight Sync** (the rest of this repo; see the
root [`README.md`](../README.md)), drives this CLI from Steam's Game Mode: a Quick Access Menu panel with a
*Sync now* button and an *Open Moonlight* button, a Stream button on the
library page of every owned game the host publishes, and a Titles page for
fixing a wrong match without leaving Game Mode. It is a thin frontend --
no second `shortcuts.vdf` parser or writer, no live `AddShortcut` calls --
that bundles this CLI, built from the same commit, installs it to
`~/.local/bin/moonlight-steam-sync`, and shells out to it as a subprocess,
relaying its `--json` event stream to the plugin's own UI. Concretely, it
drives:

- **`--json`** (see "Machine-readable output" above) to read structured
  events instead of parsing human progress lines.
- **`--owned-apps PATH`** (see "Games you own on Steam" above), which it
  writes fresh before every run from the Deck's own Steam library, so
  titles the account already owns get a hidden shortcut and a Stream
  button instead of a second tile.
- **`--ignore-file PATH`** (see "Ignoring, removing, listing" above) for
  its own ignore list, kept outside `config.toml` since the tool never
  writes that file.
- **`--client-shortcut`** (see "Games you own on Steam" above) for the
  hidden `Moonlight` shortcut its *Open Moonlight* button launches.
- **`--park-unpublished`** (see "Multiple hosts" above), so switching the
  plugin's active host hides what the other host does not publish instead
  of leaving stale tiles behind.
- **`--hide-host-apps`** (see "Desktop and Steam Big Picture" above), from
  the plugin release that replaces those two tiles with panel buttons
  (it needs this CLI at v0.4.0 or later).
- **`--commit await-exit`** (see "Steam must restart" above), because the
  plugin can only ask Steam to exit from Game Mode -- gamescope-session
  restarts the client on its own -- and must never start it itself.

The plugin never parses or writes `shortcuts.vdf`, never calls a live
Steam API to add, hide, rename or reconfigure a shortcut
(`AddShortcut`/`SetAppHiddenState`/`SetShortcutName`/
`SetCustomArtworkForApp`/...), and never touches `grid/` directly: this CLI
stays the one writer, exactly as it is for a standalone install. See the
root [`README.md`](../README.md) for installing the plugin and
`~/specs/moonlight-steam-sync/decky-plugin.md` for the full design; its
CLI-facing contract is this README's "Usage" and "Machine-readable output"
sections plus `AGENTS.md`'s pointer to the spec sections that pin down the
flag and event-schema surface.

## Development

From `cli/`:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
ruff check .
pytest
```

The artwork tests run against recorded API responses in
`tests/fixtures/art/`, so the suite never touches the network. Those
recordings are currently synthetic -- see
[`tests/fixtures/art/README.md`](tests/fixtures/art/README.md) for what each
one covers and how to replace them with real captures via
`SGDB_API_KEY=... python3 scripts/record_fixtures.py`. The end-to-end tests
in `tests/test_sync_e2e.py` run the whole `sync` / `remove` / `ignore` /
`list` chain against a temporary Steam tree, a fake `moonlight` on `PATH`
and a fake Steam process, including the 500-title resumability test that
kills a run after N calls and checks the rerun does exactly the remaining
work.

See [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for the module map, coding rules, and the
resumability contract every durable step in this codebase has to keep.

The repo root's `scripts/build_cli.py` builds the release zipapp from
`src/` (`python -m zipapp`'s own machinery, with `__pycache__` and
egg-info left out); CI's `cli` job builds it and smoke-runs `--version` and
`doctor` against it on Python 3.11 and 3.13.5 on every pull request, and
the root `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds it again on a `v*` tag,
bundles it into the plugin zip and attaches it to the release. See
[`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for the CLI's history up to `v0.4.0`, the
root [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) for what changed since, and the
root [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md#cutting-a-release) for the exact steps to
cut a release.
