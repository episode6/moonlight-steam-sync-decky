## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The Moonlight Sync Decky plugin, scaffolded from the Decky plugin
  template: `plugin.json` (no `_root`), the pinned CLI release in
  `package.json` (`"moonlightSteamSync": "0.3.0"`), MIT license.
- The backend (`main.py` over `py_modules/moonlight_sync/`): every callable
  of the plugin's contract, the CLI runner that relays `--json` events as
  `sync_event` / `sync_done`, one sync at a time, timeouts, SIGINT on stop
  and on unload (a child whose output pipes stay open, or whose output
  cannot be read, is still killed and reaped), and the plugin's own `settings.json`, `ignore.json`,
  `owned-apps.json` and `pending.json`. `search`, `pin`, `unpin`,
  `set_ignored`, `layouts` and `record_layout` answer "not yet".
- The bundled CLI: installed to `~/.local/bin/moonlight-steam-sync` on load
  when missing or older (atomically, never downgrading); "CLI not
  installed" / "CLI too old" states with every CLI action disabled.
- The SteamGridDB key: stored in the CLI's own key file (mode 0600),
  following the CLI's config → environment → key-file precedence, with only
  the last four characters ever shown.
- The Quick Access panel: host dropdown with switch-and-sync, reachability
  with "last seen", Sync now with progress and Stop, Open Moonlight, the
  four counters and Last sync; the first-run "No host yet" state.
- The restart flow: a Restart now / Later prompt with a countdown when a
  sync is ready to write (and for art-only or stopped runs that saved
  images), the in-game guard, and the persistent "Restart Steam to apply"
  row that re-runs the sync and restarts at once.
- Settings pages: Host (add with a pairing check, switch, forget), Artwork
  (key field, Retry missing art, Re-fetch all art), Advanced (layout-copy
  toggle, restart countdown, Remove everything) and About (both CLI
  versions, the pin, plugin version, log path and log tail).
- Docker-free packaging (`scripts/package.py`) and the strict CLI
  downloader (`backend/entrypoint.sh`); CI with frontend, backend, probe-kit
  and package jobs.
- Tests: pytest against a fake CLI replaying hand-written NDJSON fixtures,
  and vitest over the frontend's pure modules reading the same fixtures.
