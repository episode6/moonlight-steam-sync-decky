## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The Moonlight Sync Decky plugin, scaffolded from the Decky plugin
  template: `plugin.json` (no `_root`), the pinned CLI release in
  `package.json` (`"moonlightSteamSync": "0.3.0"`), MIT license.
- The backend (`main.py` over `py_modules/moonlight_sync/`): every callable
  of the plugin's contract, the CLI runner that relays `--json` events as
  `sync_event` / `sync_done`, one sync at a time, timeouts, SIGINT on stop
  and on unload (a child whose output pipes stay open, or whose output
  cannot be read, is still killed and reaped), and the plugin's own `settings.json`, `ignore.json`,
  `owned-apps.json`, `pending.json` and `layouts.json`.
- The busy guard is symmetric: a `sync`, `art` or `remove` run is refused
  while a `match` (a pin or unpin) is still being written, as well as the
  other way round, since both write `matches.json`.
- The Stream button: every owned game the active host publishes gets a
  **Stream** row on its library page (a patch of the `/library/app/:appid`
  route written from Decky's primitives) that runs the hidden shortcut
  through Steam; only a toast while a game is already running.
- Controller-layout copy: on each Stream press and once after a sync's
  restart (over every Stream button, once Steam has loaded the shortcut
  list), the real game's `workshop://` / `template://` selection is set on
  its hidden shortcut through Steam Input when the shortcut has no
  selection of its own, never overwriting one; the Deck's controller is
  found by type. Results (`copied` / `kept` / `unavailable`) are recorded
  in `layouts.json` (`layouts` / `record_layout`) and shown on the Titles
  row as copied / own layout / Steam default / unavailable, and next to the
  button. The Advanced toggle turns the copy off.
- **Choose layout** on a Stream button's Titles row opens Steam's own
  layout picker for the hidden shortcut (hidden when the client lacks it).
- The layout strategy switch: `DEFAULT_LAYOUT_STRATEGY` (`copy`) in
  `src/lib/layouts.ts`, overridable per device by `layout_strategy` in
  `settings.json`; `picker` makes no Steam Input calls and leaves Choose
  layout as the only layout affordance. Pending the PR-0 probes.
- The Titles page (Settings → Titles, also opened from the panel's
  header): every title the active host publishes, joined from `list` and
  `status`, with Steam's capsule, the match line, a badge (stream button,
  shortcut, unmatched, ignored, parked, duplicate) and chips (fuzzy, pinned,
  same game on another host, art refreshes on next sync); the All / Stream
  buttons / Shortcuts / Unmatched / Ignored filters, Show parked, pages of
  50, and the last cached listing when the host is unreachable or while a
  sync is running.
- Change match: searches Steam's store and SteamGridDB, shows one list
  (Steam first) with what each result would make of the title ("becomes
  stream button" for an owned game), marks the current match, offers No
  match, and pins with `match --defer-art` so the next sync applies it and
  re-fetches the art. Ignore / Unignore edit the plugin's `ignore.json`.
- The backend's `search`, `pin`, `unpin` and `set_ignored`.
- The bundled CLI: installed to `~/.local/bin/moonlight-steam-sync` on load
  when missing or older (atomically, never downgrading); "CLI not
  installed" / "CLI too old" states with every CLI action disabled.
- The SteamGridDB key: stored in the CLI's own key file (mode 0600),
  following the CLI's config → environment → key-file precedence, with only
  the last four characters ever shown.
- The Quick Access panel: host dropdown with switch-and-sync, reachability
  with "last seen", Sync now with progress and Stop, Open Moonlight, the
  four counters and Last sync; the first-run "No host yet" state, and a
  Retry when the backend itself did not answer at load.
- The restart flow: a Restart now / Later prompt with a countdown (0-30 s)
  when a sync is ready to write (and for art-only or stopped runs that saved
  images), the in-game guard, and the persistent "Restart Steam to apply"
  row that re-runs the sync and restarts at once. Both the prompt and the
  persistent row honour the in-game guard: while a game is running the row
  is disabled ("A game is running; exit it first") and an immediate run that
  reaches its wait shows the prompt instead of shutting Steam down.
- Settings pages: Host (add with a pairing check, switch, forget), Artwork
  (key field, Retry missing art, Re-fetch all art), Advanced (layout-copy
  toggle, restart countdown, Remove everything) and About (both CLI
  versions, the pin, plugin version, log path and log tail).
- Docker-free packaging (`scripts/package.py`) and the strict CLI
  downloader (`backend/entrypoint.sh`); CI with frontend, backend, probe-kit
  and package jobs.
- Tests: pytest against a fake CLI replaying hand-written NDJSON fixtures,
  and vitest over the frontend's pure modules reading the same fixtures.
